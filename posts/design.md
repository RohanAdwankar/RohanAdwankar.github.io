# Design

I'm interested in creating fresh desings that feel exciting to use.
Here is a running list of some attempts at creating novel designs.

## Codemaps

[OxDraw](https://github.com/RohanAdwankar/oxdraw) has a codemaps feature which explores the idea of navigating a codebase graphically.
AI generates a mapping of the codebase to a diagram and then in the UI the developer can click on different nodes in the diagram in order to navigate to differnt parts of the codebase.
The user can then even open these parts of the codebase in their designated editor.
The design idea I aimed to explore in this feature was how can we make diagrams my dynamic and information dense.

## Infinite Toggles 

[Unravel](https://rohanadwankar.github.io/unravel) enables infinite toggles. The idea is to make exploring the space feel frictionless. This is intensified in auto mode where the toggles constantly unravel.
